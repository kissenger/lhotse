      <h1>Snorkelling in Britain</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to Snorkelology - where we give a glimpse beneath the waves  
          We are all about snorkelling in Britain.  Find out about the best British snorkelling sites,
        snorkelling hints and tips, 
      </p>

      <p class="blockquote">
        The British coastline is one of the world's most dynamic, thriving marine habitats.
      </p>

      <p>
        This diversity is driven by the combination of high tidal range and strong currents around our shores,
        which bring warm, nutrient-rich waters from the Atlantic to the surface, promoting plankton growth
        â€“ the foundation of the marine food chain.
      </p>

      <p class="blockquote">
        When conditions are right, snorkelling in Britain brings a connection with marine life that
        can equal any tropical location.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sheer variety on offer is stunning: you can snorkel Scottish sea lochs,
        sheltered bays, shipwrecks, tidal pools, kelp forests, sandy seabeds and rocky reefs; witness sharks, seals,
        scorpionfish, octopus, and cuttlefish; watch the sun rising through sea arches or spy conger eels hunting
        in the dusk; immerse yourself in the miniature world of the many and various sea slugs and marvel at the
        unimaginable enormity of the oceans.
