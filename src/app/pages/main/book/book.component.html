      <h2>Snorkelling Adventures in Britain </h2>

      <p>
        Snorkelling is the perfect family adventure for people who love the water and the natural world.  It is free and accessible
        to people of all ages and abilities, but there is a skill in selecting safe sites with abundant underwater life.
